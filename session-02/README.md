# 02. Web Programming in Go

The lecture gives quick a re-cap on web foundations and components of web
systems and web services. We discuss the trade-offs between a monolithic and a
microservices architecture for scalability.
In the hands-on part, you will learn how to develop web clients and servers and
how to work with JSON in Go. Finally, you will see how you can deploy your
application on Google's cloud platform.

## Outline
