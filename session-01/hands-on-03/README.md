# 3. Hello Go!

Now it's time to get your hands a bit dirty and write your own first Go program.  
The [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) tutorial by Google
is a great start for that.

In the tutorial, you will create an application, a simple library and Go unit
tests.

**Follow the whole tutorial!**

### Questions
1. Can you explain what a package is?
2. What is "fmt"?
3. Rename the `Reverse` function into `reverse`. What happens? Why is that?

## Go Tour

Follow the [official Go tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) in your
browser to get a more complete overview over the language.

Note: You can also grab the tour locally:

```
go get golang.org/x/tour/gotour
```

Then you can run `gotour` and visit http://127.0.0.1:3999/welcome/1

### Questions
1. What is the difference between the types `int` and `int64`?
2. What is a pointer?
3. What is the difference between an array and a slice in Go? How are they stored in memory?
4. Can you have memory leaks in Go? How?

### Go Playground
Note: The same application that powers the Go Tour is also available to as a service
to tryout or share code snippets: https://play.golang.org

## Moving on

There are two slightly more advanced reads. If have not time for this during
class, you probably want to go over these until next week ;-)

1. Go over the [Go Programming Language Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec)  
(You don't need to read all in detail).
2. Read [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

### Questions
1. What is an interface?
2. How are errors handled in Go?
